# Graph-Based Skin Lesion Classification and Similarity Detection

## Project Theme

**Graph-Based Skin Lesion Classification and Similarity Detection for Early Diagnosis**

In South Africa, especially in rural areas, access to specialized dermatological care is often limited. Early detection of malignant skin lesions, such as melanoma, is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. Our project aims to develop a desktop application that assists healthcare professionals by classifying skin lesion images as benign or malignant using graph-based techniques. Additionally, the application will retrieve similar historical cases to support more informed diagnoses.

## Features

- Load and visualize skin lesion images
- Construct graph-based representations from image data (e.g., pixel connectivity, superpixels, or keypoint graphs)
- Classify lesions using graph-based machine learning models
- Retrieve and display similar historical lesion cases from a local dataset
- Interactive user interface for healthcare practitioners

---

## Motivation

Skin cancer is a growing concern globally, and early diagnosis significantly improves survival rates. By leveraging graph-based image analysis, we aim to support under-resourced healthcare settings with a tool that mimics the decision-making process of dermatologists using both classification and case-based reasoning.
